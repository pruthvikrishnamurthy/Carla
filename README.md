# Carla
Digital Twin System for Automotive Safety with MIL and HIL Integration of Safety Controller with Carla and Simulink


How to use these models:

These MATLAB Simulink models require ROS and CARLA Simulator pre-installed and configured in your system. For Hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) Simulation, the ECU needs to be connected to the PC with USB CAN cable. The ECU communicates to the CARLA Simulator via CAN and ROS using the Simulink model as the bridge. 

Please take a look at the two video demos to see how the Digital Twin setup works.
